I am learning new framework 'flutter' using programming language called 'dart'.
These are my applications while I am trying to learn .
hope it helps anyone.
### What is Flutter?
a framework for creating cross-platform applications with just a single code base. So you don't have to write different versions of your code to make it work on web, desktop, ios and android.
